## Description: 
To develop an Al/ML-based platform that forecasts the prices of essential food commodities, such as pulses and onions, using historical data, seasonal trends, and real-time market inputs. The platform will employ advanced machine learning models, like ARIMA or LSTM, to predict price fluctuations and recommend strategic market interventions for stabilizing prices.


## Hypotheses:
### Seasonal Variation Hypothesis:
1. The prices of essential commodities fluctuate due to predictable seasonal patterns (e.g., increased demand during festivals or supply disruptions during monsoons).
2. By analyzing historical trends, we can predict future price surges and suggest stabilization strategies.

### Supply Chain Impact Hypothesis:
1. Disruptions in supply chains (e.g., transport strikes, weather events, or logistical delays) significantly impact commodity prices.
2. Early detection of these disruptions through predictive analytics can help mitigate price volatility.

## Objective: 
To create a system that analyzes historical price trends, seasonal patterns, crop production estimates, and market intelligence to predict price changes. The platform should provide actionable insights for timely market interventions, including the release of buffer stocks, to stabilize prices, Potential Impact: The AI/ML platform will enhance decision-making by providing accurate price predictions and market outlooks, supporting the Department of Consumer Affairs in managing price volatility. It will contribute to more efficient market interventions, reducing food price instability, supporting farmers, and ensuring food security for consumers.

## How It Works:
1. Data Collection: Gather historical price data of essential commodities like pulses, onions, etc.
2. Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, adjusting for seasonality and other factors.
3. Model Development: Train a machine learning model (ARIMA or LSTM) on the prepared data.
4. Price Prediction: Use the trained model to predict future prices.
5. Market Recommendations: Based on predicted price fluctuations, suggest strategic market interventions to prevent extreme price swings.
